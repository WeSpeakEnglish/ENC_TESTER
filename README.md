# ENC_TESTER
STM32F100 plus mechanical ENCODER ( (Both - falling and rising - interrupts based discriminator) + KS0066 based two string display
+stepping motor control 
The stepping motor rotate Encoder. We calculate revolutions of the stepping motor and steps calculated by encoder for both directions separately and display the result on the display.
Optimization TBD. Nortos awaiting instead of delays TBD. NORTOS.powered.
